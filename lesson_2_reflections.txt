What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

i am making this change directly through server.Thanks git
